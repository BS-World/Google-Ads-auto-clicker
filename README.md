# Google Ads Auto Clicker

## Overview
The Google Ads Auto Clicker is a Python script that automates browsing and interaction with advertisements on a specified YouTube channel using Selenium and the Microsoft Edge WebDriver. The script mimics user behavior by visiting the channel, scrolling through the page, and clicking on ads found within the page.

## Features
- **Automated Browsing**: Visits a specified YouTube channel multiple times.
- **Ad Interaction**: Identifies and clicks on Google Ads within iframes.
- **Random User-Agent**: Mimics different browsers to prevent detection.
- **Multi-threading**: Simulates multiple concurrent visitors to the website.
- **Scrolling**: Automatically scrolls down the page to load additional ads.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Selenium
- Microsoft Edge WebDriver
- Edge browser installed on your machine

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

2. **Install Dependencies**:

3. **Download Microsoft Edge WebDriver**:
   - Download the appropriate version of the Edge WebDriver that matches your Edge browser version from [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/).
   - Place the `msedgedriver.exe` in a directory of your choice (e.g., `D:/Driver_Notes/`).

## Configuration
- Update the `EDGE_DRIVER_PATH` in the script to point to the location of `msedgedriver.exe`.
- Modify the `urls` list to include any other YouTube channels you want to target.
- Adjust the `user_agents` list as needed for more variety in user-agent strings.

## Usage
Run the script using Python:
```bash
python auto_clicker.py
```

The script will:
- Randomly visit the specified YouTube channel.
- Search for ad containers and click on any found ads.
